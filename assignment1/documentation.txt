Our solution tries to be as generic as possible. In fact, the "hardcoded" sections are limited to
instantiate the sensor with their own position and to the direction of the switch according to the
critical section. In order to achieve this kind of result we decided to put the Switch entity
at top-level in the class hierarchy. This class contains the sensors associated with it and the
critical sections connected to it. Certain instances of Critical sections are shared among consecutive
switches. This configuration allows to a certain level to abstract from the map configuration.

Our implementation uses a total of 20 sensors; 4 of them are reserved to stop trains at stations.
Apart from that every switch uses 3 sensors and the X-cross section is represented by a dummy switch
instance. This last case uses 4 sensors.

Regarding the critical section choice we decided that every single track segment is a critical section.
An additional one is used to control the train flow in the X-cross. This brings the total number
of critical sections to 9.
